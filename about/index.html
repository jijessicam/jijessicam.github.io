			<li>because i don't like css. next question.</li>
		</ul>	
	  <li>what's your favorite website?</li>

	  <li>please tell me about the tools you use for digital security.</li>
		<ul>
			<li>lol no one has ever actually asked me this but for reference: mozilla firefox (browser), duckduckgo (search), tunnelbear (vpn), 
				lastpass (password manager), httpseverywhere (browser extension), privacybadger/ghostery (browser extensions), 
				authy/duo (two-factor authentication). if I was wiser I'd also insist on using e2e encrypted messaging services, but 
				you can't have everything I guess.

	<ul>
	  <li>why is this website so ugly?</li>
		<ul>
			<li>because i don't like css. next question.</li>
		</ul>	
	  <li>what's your favorite website?</li>
		<ul>
			<li>the absolutely incomparable <a href="https://www.squidsquid.com">squidsquid.com.</a></li>
		</ul>
	  <li>please tell me about the tools you use for digital security.</li>
		<ul>

				lol no one has ever actually asked me this but for reference: mozilla firefox (browser), duckduckgo (search), tunnelbear (vpn), lastpass (password manager), httpseverywhere (browser extension), ublock origin/privacybadger/ghostery (browser extensions), authy/duo (two-factor authentication). if I was wiser I'd also insist on using e2e encrypted messaging services, but you can't have everything I guess. p.s. customize your privacy settings on every single app and service you use, and also check <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">haveibeenpwned</a> regularly. be safe out there friends.

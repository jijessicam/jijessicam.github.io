dude this book has it ALL.* it's got spaceships. it's got necromancers...in space. it's got an _incredibly spicy_ enemies-to-lovers queer relationship. it's got skeletons out the wazoo. it's got a mysterious haunted manse (in space) filled with puzzles and deathtraps and spooky secret rooms. it's got a central arc that's half tournament, half murder mystery, one hundred percent designed to hit all of the pleasure centers in your dumb animal brain that go bananas when a whole bunch of characters are introduced pre-sorted into arbitrary designations like hogwarts houses or hunger games districts. (in this case it's nine houses, each of which comes with a cool-ass skull sigil and a motto and a necromantic speciality. it's cool as hell. don't @ me.) it's got an absolutely bonkers main character who talks like a nonstop tweet thread and just wants to swing her sword around, which, _same_. it's got a distinctly YA vibe to it but is 200% better than that entire subgenre simply because it refuses to take itself too seriously. it simply oozes "style over substance" but, astonishingly, contains ample amounts of both style and substance. it has an absolutely _terrible_ cover blurb that, while technically accurate, completely fails at conveying just how weird and wacky and frankly charming this book is. you'll either love it or hate it. i give it 10/10 decapitated skeleton heads. 

*also, the fact that like 25% of the inspiration for the concept clearly came from a pun on "necromantic/romantic" absolutely SENDS ME.
